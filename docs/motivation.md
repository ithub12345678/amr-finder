## Motivation

I am a third-year undergraduate student in Bioengineering with an interest in
computational biology and genomics. Antimicrobial resistance is a major global
health challenge, and this project allows me to apply bioinformatics, algorithmic
thinking, and biological reasoning to a real-world problem.

This capstone is intended to demonstrate problem-solving skills beyond simple
pipeline integration, focusing on confidence estimation and biological interpretation.
