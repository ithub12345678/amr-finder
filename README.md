# AMR Finder

A reproducible antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene detection tool that performs
BLAST-based screening of bacterial genome assemblies and introduces two innovations:
(1) a multi-factor confidence scoring system and
(2) fragment reconstruction of split gene hits across contigs.

## Objectives
- Detect known AMR genes from bacterial genome assemblies
- Reduce false positives using confidence scoring
- Reconstruct fragmented AMR genes across contigs
- Provide interpretable resistance summaries

## Status
Phase 0 – Project initialization
